This extension was largely inspired by the extension Follow_Up created by amulyakhare:
https://github.com/amulyakhare/Thunderbird-Follow-Up-Extension

This extension will mark an email as "Must be answered before:" 
and reminds the user to ping its correspondent if there is no answer by then.

This extension requires the installation of the Lightning extension.
